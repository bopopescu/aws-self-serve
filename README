This is a self-provisioning portal for AWS.  It allows
users to provision their own VMs on your account on EC2,
without your intervention.  It should be useful for giving
training sessions and tutorials.

To get started, you will need:
* A Google App Engine account (this is an app engine application)
* An AWS account
* An AMI you wish to provision
* A recaptcha account

You need to put your details into settings.py, upload to app
engine and go!
